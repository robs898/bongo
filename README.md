# Robbie's bongo

Here I attempt to explain hard to learn ideas in a simple way.

As Richard Feynman once said:

> I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it.

The name "bongo" is a nod to Feynman's love of the [bongo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKTSaezB4p8)

## Navigation

Must read first allows you to understand hard to learn ideas from several small simple ideas.

Case: [Money](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/Money.md) should be read before [Pension](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/Pension.md)

## Contributing

Ideas are should be a few lines like a [capsule review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_review).

Please only use the [ten hundred most used words](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/phpspellcheck/dictionaries/1000.dicin).

Except for idea names. Case: [Pension](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/Pension.md)
