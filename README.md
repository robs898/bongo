# Robbie's bongo

Here I attempt to explain complex ideas in a simple, concise way.

As Richard Feynman once said:

> I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it.

The name "bongo" is a nod to Feynman's love of the [bongo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKTSaezB4p8)

## Navigation

All ideas are sandboxed to just a few lines like a [capsule review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_review).

The required reading allows you to understand complex ideas from several small simple explanations.

For example [Money](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/Money.md) should be read before [Pension](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/Pension.md)
