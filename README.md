# bongo

## Premise

Here I attempt to explain complex ideas in a simple, concise way.

As Richard Feynman once said:

> I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it.

I want to try and see if I really understand complex ideas by reducing them to a "freshman level".

The name "bongo" is a nod to Feynman's love of the [bongo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKTSaezB4p8)
