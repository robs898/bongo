In 1914 the prince of Austria-Hungary was assassinated which prompted Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia.

Germany sided with Austria-Hungary and they attempted to end the war quickly by invading France first.

However, the invasion of Belgium (along the way to France) prompted [Britain](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/Britain.md) to join the war.

Britain helped hold off Germany's attempt to quickly invade France. This resulted in the war stagnating with [trench warfare](https://github.com/robs898/bongo/blob/master/TrenchWarfare.md) for 3 years.

As technology advanced, tanks and airplanes were used to counter the effectiveness of trenches.

The USA joined to fight against Germany in 1917. Although Russia was defeated in the east, Germany ran out of funding for their armies and eventually collapsed.
